- Make everything const correct

- Add .cpp files, move code there

- Compile the engine into a .lib

- use better paths, dipshit

- make CMake actually include recursively

- get a proper renderer going (pooling)

- Optimize shit

- Redesign the interpreter to just be a hashmap and stringstream (crazy idea, I know)

- Create ConVar type

- Create a client-side and server-side copy of these

- Protected server-side convars are not accessible via client console

- Protected client-side convars are not accessible via server console

- Make ent_cube actually use the Transform component and Scalar component (do this through Mesh)
